# Splay_Trees_Java
Java Data Structures : Splay Trees:

Splay tree is self-balancing BST.  Idea of splay tree is to bring the recently accessed item to root of the tree, this makes the recently searched item to be accessible in O(1) time if accessed again.

Splay trees are simpler compared to AVL and Red-Black Trees as no extra field is required in every tree node.
